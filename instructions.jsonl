{"role": "assistant", "content": "The text states that Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his concern to the new interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus regarding the attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Specifically, a minority rights group called the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC) listed 2,010 communal incidents between August 5-20, including 9 murders, 69 attacks on places of worship and 4 acts of violence against women, most of which were directed against the Hindu community. This caused Modi, as the first global leader, to convey his concern to the Yunus government."}
