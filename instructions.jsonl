{"role": "assistant", "content": "According to the text, the popular rebellion in Bangladesh that ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign saw a rise in attacks against the Hindu minority community. The Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC), a minority rights group, listed 2,010 communal incidents between August 5 and 20, including 9 murders, 69 attacks on places of worship, and 4 acts of violence against women, most of which were directed against the 13 million-strong Hindu community that makes up 7.95% of Bangladesh's population. The text states that Hindu homes and properties were attacked from the outset of the coup violence."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "The text mentions that India, which had previously viewed Bangladesh as a foreign policy success, became concerned about the situation after the rebellion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his concern to the new interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, even as Modi became the first global leader to congratulate Yunus on his appointment. The Indian government was likely worried about the potential rise of Islamist forces and the targeting of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh."}
